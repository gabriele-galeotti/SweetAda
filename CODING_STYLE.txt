SweetAda code (and the build system output) tries to follow specific rules,
both in a textually and "geometric" sense.

SweetAda code is obviously improvable, and there are areas where both Ada
semantics, style and coding rules could be obeyed better. But we try to first
make code working, then we try to consolidate it, following laws and providing
correctness.

Some decisions could seem against mainstream rules, anyway the ultimate goal
is hopefully the consistency and ease of reading. For example, the textual
output of the build system is structured, so that it can be easily parsed by
an external tool agent. Record layouts have a structure (where possible) to
automate their dissection, since there are regions which can be easily
isolated, and do not require a tedious line-oriented parsing. This (where
possible) holds also for normal executable code.

Sometimes we use acronyms with leading and trailing double-underscore to
highlight references or placeholders, e.g.:
__HDS__ header start
__HDE__ header end
__FIX__ to be solved
__TBD__ to be defined/done
__PTC__ patch
__INF__ informative
__REF__ reference
__NOP__ no operation
__NRC__ code not reached
__DNO__ does not occur
__WNG__ warning
__TXT__ text object
__FLN__ filename
__DSC__ description
__PRE__ file to be pre-processed
__DVL__ development level
__HSH__ hash value

Comments have single space after "--".

Comments should be exquisitely written for technical understanding, without
irony, personal sarcasm or jokes.

We use a long string of "-" to separate sections of sequential code. The
length of the string could be variable and depends on the context.
Long comments composed of multiple phrases should have a leading and trailing
empty comment line, with precise punctuation. Short one-phrase comments could
be in-lined, without initial capitalization and without a trailing period.
Sometimes we pragma-override the line-length limit to make code compact, e.g.,
in long register layout definitions or repeated subprogram specifications.

One unit "with" per line.
This helps the gprdeps utility (which computes unit dependencies), which is
not yet sophisticated enough to parse complex Ada syntax.

"use" should be placed inside package/subprogram declarative region.

with'ing of aspects should be indented on a line itself (except inside a
record layout and maybe "Unreferenced" variables), with an appropriate
structure. See existing code.

When we are in a declarative region, we try to follow a (loose) sequence like:
- pragmas
- use clauses
- untyped constants
- types
- typed constants
- variable objects
- subprograms
(of course forward declarations can break this sequence).

Names should resemble documentation.
Register, field and constant names should be exactly those written in the
reference manual, case included, unless conflicts and/or special reasons
exist.

Sometimes we write "3" in place of "e", e.g., "Rang3" instead of "Range",
"D3lay" instead of "Delay", "Typ3" instead of "Type".

Sometimes we write "7" in place of "t", e.g., "A7" instead of "AT", "ou7"
instead of "out".

Register layouts and constants are often defined without specific bitfield
typing, as they are already mostly typed as Bits_XX/Unsigned_XX. Further
specific typing makes code excessively bloated, and the provided field-prefix
constants should be used. Furthermore, when working on a low-level detail, you
are required to exactly understand what you are doing, and how mixing
bitfields on a chance is dangerous, even with the help of Ada type system.
Seeing a prefix that match the bitfield is way explanatory, but there are many
cases where a specific type is employed, because it is useful when creating
variables of that type. Anyway, post-typing a bitfield is possible without too
much effort since we already have a good starting point, and with the help of
a modern mainstream editor, such a refactorization turns out to be quite easy.

There are no strict rules for variable naming, one can select "camel case" or
underscores for literal readability, possibly capitalizing the first letter.
When semantics requires readability, a mixed style could be employed, because
the word particles help comprehension, but placing too many underscores could
lengthen the name. A good rule of thumb is to shorten names, trying to
preserve their scope and/or functionality. Single-letter names should be used
sparingly and only when their functionality is trivial, e.g., in simple loops.
As described above, reference manuals and technical "jargon" used in official
documentation take precedence over Ada fine-detailed naming schemes. This is
the only remarkable rule because a 1-1 is absolutely necessary, since code
should match the object that is being coded. Being said that, generally
speaking, the rules about variable names are always a matter of taste and
discussion, so this aspect is more relaxed. And, as always, common sense is
the best rule.

Simple subprograms with input/output arguments generally have "Value" as input
parameter and "Result" as function output.

When passing a numbered item to a subprogram (e.g., the bit number in a
pattern, or the peripheral number in a set of devices), we often use the name
"ItemN" ("item number", e.g., BitN or DeviceN). When passing the number of
items (e.g., the number of bits to check in a pattern, or the number of
peripheral devices to configure in a system), we often use the name "NItems"
("number of items", e.g., NBits or NDevices).

Hexadecimal literals all uppercase, C-style "0x" prefix preferred in comments.

Some object prefixes/suffixes/abbreviations:
Idx = index
Mem = memory
Reg = register

When dealing with subprograms, the operation carried out by the code should
come last, e.g., "CPU_SR_Read" instead of "Read_CPU_SR". This helps in
recognizing functionality vs modules, as you can lookup them easily.

Packages could be use'd or not. We use them when we heavy-reference objects
coming from those packages (so lowering the code bloat), like in various
platform/CPU-specific code. We try to not use them in common code like the
core complex.

(Unchecked)-type conversions have generally the form To_*, where the target
type could be abbreviated since the conversion should be mostly localized
inside a limited region.

No unchecked conversions in specs, use wrappers in the body instead.
