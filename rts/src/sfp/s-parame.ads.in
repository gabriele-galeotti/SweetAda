--  Default version used when no target-specific version is provided

--  This package defines some system dependent parameters for GNAT. These
--  are values that are referenced by the runtime library and are therefore
--  relevant to the target machine.

--  The parameters whose value is defined in the spec are not generally
--  expected to be changed. If they are changed, it will be necessary to
--  recompile the run-time library.

--  The parameters which are defined by functions can be changed by modifying
--  the body of System.Parameters in file s-parame.adb. A change to this body
--  requires only rebinding and relinking of the application.

--  Note: do not introduce any pragma Inline statements into this unit, since
--  otherwise the relinking and rebinding capability would be deactivated.

package System.Parameters is
   pragma Pure;

   --  Type used to provide task stack sizes to the runtime. Sized to permit
   --  stack sizes of up to half the total addressable memory space. This may
   --  seem excessively large (even for 32-bit systems), however there are many
   --  instances of users requiring large stack sizes (for example string
   --  processing).

   Unspecified_Size : constant Size_Type := Size_Type'First;
   --  Value used to indicate that no size type is set

   Stack_Grows_Down : constant Boolean := @STACK_GROWS_DOWN@;
   --  This constant indicates whether the stack grows up (False) or
   --  down (True) in memory as functions are called. It is used for
   --  proper implementation of the stack overflow check.

   Runtime_Default_Sec_Stack_Size : constant Size_Type := @RUNTIME_DEFAULT_SEC_STACK_SIZE@;
   --  The run-time chosen default size for secondary stacks that may be
   --  overriden by the user with the use of binder -D switch.

   -- Behavior of Pragma Finalize_Storage_Only --
   ----------------------------------------------

   --  Garbage_Collected is a Boolean constant whose value indicates the
   --  effect of the pragma Finalize_Storage_Entry on a controlled type.

   --    Garbage_Collected = False

   --      The system releases all storage on program termination only,
   --      but not other garbage collection occurs, so finalization calls
   --      are omitted only for outer level objects can be omitted if
   --      pragma Finalize_Storage_Only is used.

   --    Garbage_Collected = True

   --      The system provides full garbage collection, so it is never
   --      necessary to release storage for controlled objects for which
   --      a pragma Finalize_Storage_Only is used.

   Garbage_Collected : constant Boolean := False;
