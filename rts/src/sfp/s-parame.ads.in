--  Default version used when no target-specific version is provided

--  This package defines some system dependent parameters for GNAT. These
--  are values that are referenced by the runtime library and are therefore
--  relevant to the target machine.

--  The parameters whose value is defined in the spec are not generally
--  expected to be changed. If they are changed, it will be necessary to
--  recompile the run-time library.

--  The parameters which are defined by functions can be changed by modifying
--  the body of System.Parameters in file s-parame.adb. A change to this body
--  requires only rebinding and relinking of the application.

--  Note: do not introduce any pragma Inline statements into this unit, since
--  otherwise the relinking and rebinding capability would be deactivated.
